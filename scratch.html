<blockquote><strong>Regularly misunderstood, always gaining understanding.</strong></blockquote>
								
<p>I create music with a blend of high artistry, "phat" grooves, and complex arrangements. Whether producing solo or working with my music collective, the Sound Experiment, I strive to move audiences through compelling storytelling and beautiful composition.</p>			
<p>I feel comfortable mixing idioms and ideas from different genres and time periods to create works that are familiar, yet invoke a sense of freshness and modernity. 	I'm currently interested in exploring how the fusion of modern and classic elements can create high art in any genre. </p
<p>I see creating and experiencing music as a way to acknowledge the human condition and enhance connection in our lives. Music has let me explore all the parts of myself - inlcuding the parts that society wants us to ignore/suppress. This exploration has brought me a sense of freedom that I wish to share with the world. Music allows us to express humanity as pure vibration - transcending all borders and boundaries in the process. In my pieces, I create a connection between the music and listener on both intellectual and emotional levels. "Changing hearts and minds" is an expression I often use to summarize these ideals. Music-making requires trust between the artists on stage and the audience. This trust builds community, and that community allows us to create forward-thinking spaces for people to thrive.</p>
<p>I celebrate the music of the Black Diaspora in all forms, and as a continous legacy: the same energy that produced the blues led to jazz, rock & roll, funk, disco, and hip-hop. As a Black, queer, and neurodivergent person, music is a major part of my self-exploration, and connection to my highest self. Through song, I can channel a portal to my ancestors and acknowledge their strength in the face of adversity. At the end of the day, this work is spiritual, a celebration of life.</p><p>I celebrate the music of the Black Diaspora in all forms, and as a continous legacy: the same energy that produced the blues led to jazz, rock & roll, funk, disco, and hip-hop.

<p>Known for their electrifying stage presence and chemistry, Hyperius Blake & the Sound Experiment bring their music to life in dynamic live performances. With classical training, church experience, and worldly experience, the members of the Sound Experiment can "play anything". From intimate venues to grand stages, each show is an immersive and passionate experience, leaving audiences captivated by the energy and emotion conveyed through their music.</p>
<p>They acknowledge genre while transcending it at the same time. Influenced by all the music of the Black Diaspora, they combine the sounds of jazz, disco/house, hip-hop, neo-soul and world music with finesse, creating something truly unique.</p>
